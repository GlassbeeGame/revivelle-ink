## Important Notes

### Location Page Content Strategy

Location pages serve dual purposes:
1. **Local SEO** - Help the business rank for "paramedical tattoo [city]" searches
2. **Conversion** - Turn visitors into phone calls

### Content Guidelines:
- **Be Specific**: Use actual directions, drive times, and local landmarks
- **Be Helpful**: Answer real questions potential clients have about visiting from this area
- **Be Unique**: Each location page should have unique content (not duplicated)
- **Focus on Proximity**: Emphasize how close and convenient the studio is
- **Include Local Keywords**: Naturally mention the location name throughout

### Avoid These Mistakes:
- ❌ Duplicate content across location pages
- ❌ Generic directions like "head north" (be specific: "Take I-80 east to Exit 18")
- ❌ Vague drive times (specify based on normal traffic)
- ❌ Forgetting to mention major landmarks near this location
