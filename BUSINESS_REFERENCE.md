## Services Offered

### 1. Stretch Mark Camouflage Tattoo

**What It Is:**
A specialized paramedical tattoo technique that uses custom-blended pigments to match natural skin tone. By carefully tattooing pigment into white or light stretch marks, the treatment significantly reduces their appearance and creates a smoother, more even look.

**Ideal For:**
- White, silver, or light-colored stretch marks
- Fully healed stretch marks (at least 1 year old)
- Stable skin tone (no recent tanning or sun exposure)
- Clients wanting long-lasting, low-maintenance solution
- Non-pregnant/non-nursing clients
- Those with realistic expectations

**Benefits:**
- Custom pigment perfectly matched to skin tone
- Long-lasting results (3-7 years)
- Safe and effective for all skin tones
- Minimal downtime and fast healing
- Reduces visibility of white and light stretch marks
- Boosts confidence

**The Process:**
1. **Free Consultation** - Discuss goals, examine stretch marks, determine candidacy
2. **Custom Color Matching** - Create custom pigment blend for seamless results
3. **Treatment Session** - Careful tattooing with sterile single-use cartridge (numbing available)
4. **Healing & Follow-Up** - 4-6 weeks healing, typically 1-3 sessions total, spaced 8-12 weeks apart

**Common Treatment Areas:**
- Abdomen
- Hips
- Thighs
- Buttocks
- Breasts
- Arms
- Lower back
- Calves

**Pricing:**
- Starting at $250 per treatment area per session
- Most clients need 1-3 sessions for best results
- Sessions spaced 8-12 weeks apart
- Non-refundable deposit required to book
- Free initial consultation (phone or in-person)
- Total investment typically $500-$1,500 for complete treatment

**Important Notes:**
- Only treats white/silver/light stretch marks (NOT red or purple - these are still healing)
- Cannot make stretch marks completely disappear, but dramatically reduces visibility
- Requires avoiding sun exposure, swimming, and heavy sweating during healing
- Healing takes 4-6 weeks; treated area may appear darker initially then lightens

### 2. Inkless Stretch Mark Revision

**What It Is:**
A natural, pigment-free treatment that uses controlled micro-needling and specialized healing serums to stimulate the body's own collagen production. No ink or pigment is used - works with natural healing response to improve stretch mark texture, tone, and overall appearance.

**Ideal For:**
- Clients preferring natural, pigment-free approach
- Red, purple, white, or silver stretch marks (any stage)
- Those wanting to improve texture and tone without tattoo ink
- Clients willing to commit to multiple sessions (3-6 treatments)
- Those with realistic expectations about gradual improvement
- Non-pregnant/non-nursing clients

**Benefits:**
- No tattoo pigment or ink used
- Stimulates natural collagen production
- Improves texture, tone, and appearance
- Safe for all skin types and tones
- Can treat red, purple, white, and silver stretch marks
- Natural healing process with long-lasting results

**The Process:**
1. **Consultation & Assessment** - Evaluate stretch marks/skin type, discuss goals, create treatment plan
2. **Skin Preparation** - Cleanse and prep area, apply numbing cream if desired
3. **Controlled Needling** - Precise micro-needling to create controlled micro-channels, triggering collagen response
4. **Serum Infusion** - Apply and infuse specialized healing serums into micro-channels
5. **Aftercare & Follow-Up** - Detailed instructions, schedule next session (typically 3-6 treatments spaced 6-8 weeks apart)

**Common Treatment Areas:**
- Abdomen
- Hips
- Thighs
- Buttocks
- Breasts
- Arms
- Lower back
- Shoulders

**Pricing:**
- Starting at $250 per treatment area per session
- Most clients need 3-6 sessions for optimal results
- Sessions spaced 6-8 weeks apart
- Non-refundable deposit required to book
- Free initial consultation (phone or in-person)
- Total investment typically $750-$1,500 for complete series

**Important Notes:**
- Unlike camouflage tattooing, can treat stretch marks at any stage (red, purple, white, or silver)
- Results develop gradually over 3-6 months and can continue improving up to a year after final session
- More natural approach vs. tattooing which provides more dramatic color correction
- Healing takes 1-2 weeks (mild redness and sensitivity immediately after)
- Can be combined with pigment camouflage for enhanced results

**Difference from Camouflage Tattooing:**
- Inkless revision uses NO pigment - relies on natural collagen production for texture/tone improvement
- Camouflage tattooing uses custom-blended pigments for visual color blending
- Inkless is more natural; tattooing provides more dramatic color correction
- Can combine both for best overall results

### 3. Scar Camouflage & Revision

**What It Is:**
A specialized paramedical tattoo technique that blends scars into surrounding skin using custom-matched pigments. Can also use inkless revision techniques to improve scar texture before adding pigment.

**Ideal For:**
- Fully healed scars (at least 12-18 months old)
- Clients wanting to reduce visibility of surgical or injury scars
- Those with realistic expectations
- Non-keloid-prone clients (not for raised, overgrown scars)
- Stable skin tone (no recent tanning)

**Benefits:**
- Reduces visibility of surgical and injury scars
- Custom color matching for natural-looking results
- Safe for all skin tones
- Can treat C-section, tummy tuck, and surgical scars
- Inkless options available for texture improvement
- Boosts confidence and reduces self-consciousness

**The Process:**
1. **Consultation & Evaluation** - Examine scar, discuss goals, determine best approach (pigment, inkless, or combination)
2. **Treatment Planning** - Create custom color blend for pigment work; may recommend inkless revision for textured scars first
3. **Treatment Session** - Sterile, single-use equipment; numbing available for comfort
4. **Healing & Results** - 4-6 weeks healing; multiple sessions may be needed based on scar type/size

**Common Scar Types Treated:**

- Keloid scars, hypertrophic (raised) scars, and very textured scars may not be good candidates
- C-section scars must be 12-18 months postpartum, client not pregnant/nursing
- Scar tissue can sometimes be less sensitive than normal skin
- No treatment can make scars completely disappear - goal is to reduce visibility
- Results last 3-7 years depending on location, lifestyle, and sun exposure

**Pigment vs. Inkless:**
- Scar camouflage uses pigment to blend scar color into surrounding skin
- Inkless revision uses micro-needling and serums to improve scar texture without pigment
